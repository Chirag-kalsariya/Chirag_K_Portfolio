**Title:** Create online store for sell medicine in India
\
**Problems:** Prescription based checkout, Pin code based delivery charges, Low maintenance code, Performance, SEO, Adsense
\
**Platform:** By reference
\
**Tech:** Wordpress, Flutter

- Client needs a website which has low cost of maintenance and has good SEO capability. 
So, I used wordpress, woocommerce and razorypay as a payment gateway. 
Wordpress is best for SEO because it use PHP which use server side rendering.
- For performance I used webp image converter, Server level caching, and Cloudflare caching.
- For Android and IOS app development I used flutter webview based app.

Replaced Ionic with capacitor. which made page speed 
score from [20-40 to 70-90](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-heatfleet-com/90oxlselnw?form_factor=mobile).

Created own component based design system, which helped us to make different modules 
with design consistency, maintainable and scalable code.

vendor website, android and IOS app. The JSON file contains information about 
company name, logo, color palette, and some static content.
