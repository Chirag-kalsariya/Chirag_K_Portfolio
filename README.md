Chirag Kalsariya Portfolio Website. Using Nextra Docs.

# Documentation

This repo uses [Nextra Docs](https://nextra.vercel.app/) template. For more details please visit [Nextra Docs](https://nextra.vercel.app/docs).

However, I added some custom components and installed shadcn compoenents. So I am providing
few information how you can edit this site.

## Edit page content

All page mdx files are in `pages` directory. To edit page content, simply open the file in VS Code or any text editor and replace the content with your own.

You can use react components in your mdx files. For example, I have written `<SpaceBox height={'1.5rem'} />` in my `about.mdx` file.

Also you can write simple html tags in your mdx files.

## Edit Header and Footer

For header and footer, you can edit the file `theme.config.tsx`. For more details please visit [Nextra Docs Theme Configuration](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

## Edit Sidebar

For sidebar, you can edit the file `_meta.tsx`. For more details please visit [Nextra Docs Page Configuration](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/page-configuration).
